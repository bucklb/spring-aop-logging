aop with a logging slant

cloned/forked from https://github.com/RameshMF/spring-boot-tutorial/tree/master/spring-aop-advice-examples October 2019.  
Ramesh has no specifics in terms of licence or similar.  He did the hard yards in terms of getting a prpototype in place.  If you want to work from this repo then please make sure his name/details/repo remains in the code and/or readme


Exploring what can be meaningfully achieved using spring AOP in terms of centralising logging overhead.  The other asppects (fnnar!) of AOP will be explored at some point, but reducing the amount of logging code needed is the priority at the moment
